An alarm clock that looks and sounds just beautiful. Waking up has never been more smoothly.

== General Overview

The most beautiful alarm clock can be seen in the <<overview>>. It features three touch buttons, an USB-micro connector for power supply and an SD card to store alarm melodies. 

Additionally, the alarm clock connects to your WiFi to get the most accurate time. A webserver gives you easy and full control of the alarm settings.

== Touch Button Control

The touch button features depend on the current state of the alarm clock. Currently there are two states: Normal and alarm state (which includes snoozed state).

In general, the main button handles two states: longpress and shortpress events, a longpress is longer than one second. 

=== Normal State

When no alarm is present, the alarm clock is in normal state.

*Shortpress*: Display on / off

*Longpress*: Display all future alarm events

=== Alarm State

In alarm or snoozed state, the button presses have the following functions:

*Shortpress*: Snooze

*Longpress*: Hold for four seconds, until "OFF" is displayed. This shuts off the current alarm.

== SD Card for Alarm Melodies

Please use an SD card with the following data format:

* Only MP3 format is supported
* Naming of the MP3 files has to start with a 4-digit number (e.g. 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3 etc.)
* SD is FAT formatted

The songs are played in random order when the alarm goes off.
